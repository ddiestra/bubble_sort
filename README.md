Bubble sort
===========

This is just a simple bubble sort simulation built with Vue.js inside a Drupal module, develop by <a href="https://github.com/ddiestra">ddiestra</a>.

@TODO we can change the defined routes /bubblesort/shuffle and /bubblesort/step to REST API, but we need to install the REST module, also with the change to a REST API we can separate the view and the vuejs code into a simple static site and do a full headless Drupal.

Instructions
------------

I will write something in here eventually...
